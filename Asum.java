 
(1)Write a Java program that takes five numbers as input to calculate and print\\
the average of the numbers.\\



    class Asum{
    public static void main(String args[]){
   
    System.out.println("Input first number: 10");
    int firstnumber = 10;
   
    System.out.println("Input second number: 20");
    int secondnumber = 20;
   
    System.out.println("Input third number: 30");
    int thirdnumber = 30;
    
    System.out.println("Input fourth number: 40");
    int fourthnumber = 40;
   
    System.out.println("Enter fifth number: 50");
    int fifthnumber =  50;
     
    System.out.println("Average of total numbers is: " + 
    (firstnumber + secondnumber + thirdnumber + fourthnumber + fifthnumber) / 5);
   
}
    }
